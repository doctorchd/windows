Configure Git to handle line endings correctly for your operating system 
by setting the core.autocrlf configuration option.

For Windows:
git config --global core.autocrlf true

For macOS/Linux:
git config --global core.autocrlf input

The "true" setting instructs Git to convert line endings to CRLF when 
checking out files and to LF when committing files.

In contrast, the "input" setting directs Git to convert line endings to 
LF during commits while preserving them as is during checkouts.
